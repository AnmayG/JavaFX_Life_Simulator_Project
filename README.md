# JavaFX Life Simulator Project

This is a project created for my Computer Science A class using the JavaFX library to create a basic village simulation.

This uses the JavaFX library to create a really simple simulation game where you can control villagers and monsters.

It uses Java to do all the calculations and stuff.

There's nothing at all groundbreaking in this because it was a class project.
